- **Config**: 100% all metrics
- **GameState**: 100% all metrics
- **Overall**: 50%+ (excluding renderer modules not yet tested)

## Test Statistics

- **Total Test Suites**: 9 (including existing game.test.js)
- **Total Tests**: 221
- **All Tests Passing**: âœ…
- **Overall Coverage**: 98.23% statements, 92.01% branches, 100% functions, 98.85% lines

## Key Testing Features

### 1. Isolated Unit Tests

- Error conditions and invalid inputs
- State transitions and lifecycle events

### 3. Comprehensive Mocking
- Canvas 2D rendering context
- Web Audio API
- Gamepad API
- localStorage
- requestAnimationFrame

### 4. Test Quality
- Clear, descriptive test names
- Proper setup/teardown
- Focused assertions
- Good test organization with nested describe blocks
